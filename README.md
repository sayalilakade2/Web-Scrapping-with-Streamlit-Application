**Project Title**: Web Scraping with Streamlit Application 

**Project Description**:  This project involves developing a Streamlit application that allows users to search for the total number of doctors available on Practo.com based on specific location and specialization inputs. Users will enter a location into an input box and select a medical specialization from a dropdown menu. When the "Scrape" button is clicked, the application will scrape Practo.com for the number of doctor profiles matching the user's criteria and display the result directly within the app. This tool provides a simple and efficient way to access healthcare provider information based on user preferences.

**Installation Instruction**:
Set Up Your Environment: Ensure you have Python installed. You can download it from python.org. Create a virtual environmen
Install Required Libraries: Install the necessary Python libraries using pip :
streamlit
pandas
numpy
matplotlib
seaborn
requests
beautifulsoup4
selenium
Set Up Selenium (Web Scraping Tool) :Install a WebDriver: Selenium requires a WebDriver to interface with your browser. Depending on your browser, download the appropriate driver: ChromeDriver for Google Chrome
GeckoDriver for Firefox
Perform EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis): Before you start scraping, you can perform EDA on your dataset using libraries like pandas, numpy, matplotlib, and seaborn. This step is optional but can be useful for understanding the data you'll work with
Develop the Streamlit Application:Create a new Python file, web scraping.ipynb
Run the Application:
Deploy : Once your application is running locally, you can deploy it on a platform like Streamlit Sharing

**Usage**:

### How to Use the Application

1. **Open the Application:**
   - After setting up the project, open your terminal or command prompt.
   - Navigate to the directory where your `web scrapping.ipynb` file is located.
   - Start the application by running:
     ```bash
     streamlit run app.py
     ```
   - This will launch the application in your default web browser.

2. **Input Location:**
   - In the application interface, you'll see an input box labeled "Enter Location."
   - Type the name of the location (e.g., "Mumbai", "Bangalore", "Delhi") into this box.

3. **Select Specialization:**
   - Below the location input, you'll find a dropdown menu labeled "Select Specialization."
   - Click the dropdown menu and choose a medical specialization from the list provided (e.g., "Cardiologist", "Dentist", "Dermatologist", "Gynecologist").

4. **Start Scraping:**
   - After entering the location and selecting the specialization, click the "Scrape" button.
   - The application will begin scraping Practo.com for the number of doctors that match your search criteria.

5. **View Results:**
   - Once the scraping process is complete, the application will display the total number of doctor profiles available in the specified location and specialization.

1. **Enter Location:** "Mumbai"
2. **Select Specialization:** "Cardiologist"
3. **Click "Scrape"**
4. **Result Displayed:** "Number of doctors in Mumbai specializing in Cardiologist: 250" (This number is just an example.)

This simple and intuitive interface allows you to quickly find the number of doctors in a specific location and specialization using real-time data from Practo.com.

### What to Expect After Scraping

Once you click the "Scrape" button, the application will begin collecting data from Practo.com based on the location and specialization you provided. This process may take a few moments, depending on the speed of your internet connection and the availability of data on Practo.

#### After the Scraping Process is Completed:

1. **Display of Results:**
 The application will display a message indicating the total number of doctor profiles found that match your search criteria.
   
2. **Additional Information:**
 The results may include additional details, such as the time taken to complete the scraping process or any other relevant information, depending on how the application is customized.

The output is designed to be clear and concise, providing you with the specific information you need about the availability of doctors based on your search criteria.
